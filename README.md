# Phase 1 Project
# Who Its For
This website is for parents, or anybody that is taking care of babys that are within their first six months of life. This website helps you clarify some of the questions you might have regarding the babys feeding schedule, such as how many ounces of formula should the baby have in one feeding, and how many feeds per day at each month of life. 

# How To Use The Features 
once you load the website you will see a "Months old" form where you choose the baby age you are looking for.
